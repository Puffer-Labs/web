          <p>
            When I started Puffer Labs, I had one goal in mind: delivering
            stable and high quality software to our customers. Customers are the
            focus of every facet of our business. The idea is simple: deliver
            amazing products that your customers love, and everything else will
            take care of itself. Any other Fortune 500 company can say that they
            prioritize their customers, but their actions often say the
            opposite. They often have to report to stakeholders and board
            members who have different goals in mind: üí∞.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why at Puffer Labs, we don't have any board members or
            stakeholders. We don't even deal with real FIAT currency. One of the
            reasons why Puffer Labs has been voted "Least Capitalist Company" by
            the World Capitalism Federation is due to our successful integration
            with our proprietary cryptocurrency, the Puffer Coin‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puffer Labs will continue to stay on the bleeding edge of all
            technology and providing amazing software products. Our longevity is
            attributed to our employees. We hope the results will speak for
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Best,</p>
